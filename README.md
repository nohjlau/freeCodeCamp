# Introduction
[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) teaches you the fundamentals and beyond of web development in bite-sized lessons. I created this after completing each exercise to create a personal cheetsheet of snippets to reference topics that I've learned. This will likely not be useful to you unless you already know how to code. The website gives instructions on how to complete each exercise.
